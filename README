What is FSQuery
---------------
FSQuery is a command line tool, it allows you to find files in file system with a SQL-like language.

How to use it
-------------
This program is not on hackage, you need to clone this repo to use it. (Don't install it globally, it's not well tested)

    $ git clone https://github.com/qwfy/fsquery.git ./FSQuery
    $ cd FSQuery/src
    # show help message with -h
    $ runhaskell Main.hs -h
    # or, build it with
    $ ghc -o fsquery Main.hs


Example
-------
Suppose that you have built FSQuery, and the name of executable is "fsquery".

    # type "fsquery" with no arguments will drop you into REPL mode,
    # with "FSQuery <<" being the prompt.
    $ fsquery
    FSQuery << select path, size, type
    FSQuery << from ./foo
    FSQuery << where depth = 0 and size <= 1.5mib
    FSQuery << order by size desc, name asc
    FSQuery << limit 7;

will give you something like this:

    | bar             | 2.00KiB (2048B) | f |
    | another bar     | 1.00KiB (1024B) | f |
    | yet another bar | 500B            | f |
    (3 lines)

Warning
-------
Currently, there is no automated test for this program. If it type-checks, it's probably correct, so they say...
